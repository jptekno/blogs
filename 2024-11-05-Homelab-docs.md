# Welcome to Ozteklab

Hi there! I’m a Solutions Engineer with a deep passion for technology and homelabbing. Ozteklab is my space to document and share the various projects and setups I’ve tackled in my home lab environment — from networking and security to data ingestion and automation. Homelabbing has been an essential part of my learning journey, allowing me to explore new tools, sharpen my skills, and solve practical tech challenges.

In this blog, you'll find guides and insights into setting up VLANs, configuring Traefik as a reverse proxy, integrating Home Assistant for smart home automation, and working with Splunk for data ingestion and security monitoring. I’ll also share my experiences and tips for building a secure and efficient homelab environment, diving into everything from container orchestration to advanced network configurations.

Whether you're a tech enthusiast or an experienced professional, I hope these posts inspire you to experiment, learn, and build your own lab setups. Thanks for visiting Ozteklab, and happy homelabbing!
